### Subarray Sum Problem
This project implements a function to determine if a contiguous subarray within an array of integers exists that sums up to a target value. The function returns true if such a subarray exists, otherwise, it is false.

### Example
Input: arr = [4, 2, 7, 1, 9, 5], target = 17
Output: true
Explanation: The subarray [7, 1, 9] sums up to 17, equal to the target.
Constraints
The array will contain between 1 and 100,000 elements.
The elements in the array and the target sum will be between -1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
Expected Space Complexity: O(1).


### String Transformation
This project implements a function that transforms a string based on specific rules related to its length. The transformation rules are as follows:

If the length of the string is divisible by 3, the string is reversed.
If the length of the string is divisible by 5, each character in the string is replaced by its ASCII code.
If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15), the string is first reversed and then each character is replaced by its ASCII code.
Examples
Input: "Hamburger"

Output: "regrubmaH"
Explanation: The length of the string is 9, which is divisible by 3 but not by 5 or 15. Therefore, the string is reversed, resulting in "regrubmaH".
Input: "Pizza"

Output: "80 105 122 122 97"
Explanation: The length of the string is 5, which is divisible by 5 but not by 3 or 15. Therefore, each character is replaced by its ASCII code, resulting in "80 105 122 122 97".
Input: "Chocolate Chip Cookie"

Output: "eikooCpihCetalocohC"
Explanation: The length of the string is 21, which is divisible by 3 but not by 5 or 15. Therefore, the string is reversed, resulting in "eikooCpihCetalocohC".
